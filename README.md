#### January 20th, 2021
#### Able to now scrape Twitter for keywords suchas #covid, #covid19, etc. 'snscrape' library also has the capability to scrape Facebook and Instagram, that's next


#### January 27th, 2021
#### Produced a csv file of 100,000 tweets from February 25th-28th, 2020 on keyword 'covid'

#### January 30th, 2021
#### [(1,000, 8seconds), (10,000, 86seconds), (100,000, 12minutes), (223,360, 30minutes)]
#### 223,360 is the total english tweets with keyword 'covid' in February

#### February 5th, 2021
#### Data Pipeline (any dataset can be read-in at the top, then you can run all)

#### February 7th, 2021
#### Tried to obtain March 28th-30th, took over 2 hours and is too large to be uploaded to github (226MB)

#### February 13th, 2021
#### Fixed the issue with Github... 
#### git reset --hard HEAD~4
#### by using ^ this to remove the last 4 commits to github

#### February 21st, 2021
#### Began scraping for the month of March

#### February 22nd, 2021
#### It appears that the scraping tool is not functioning at full capacity, it's only scraping part way through on some days

#### Februrary 25th, 2021
#### The issue from Feb 22nd was resolved. Twitter seems to be temp-banning my searches with some daily limit. But each day that limit is erased and I can go back to querying
#### placing a time.sleep(10) after every 1000 queries seems to allow me to scrape more each day

#### February 28th, 2021
#### I'm slowly filling out the month of March. 
#### The bulk of tweets with word 'covid' seem to be around the 2nd week of March, when the "two-week shutdown until we can go back to normal" began, lol

### March 2nd, 2021
#### I've got 2/3rds of March data. I suspect collecting April, May, etc. will be *much* faster.
#### I just have to keep collecting ~600,000 tweets per day seems to be the temp-ban limit (will investigate this further)
